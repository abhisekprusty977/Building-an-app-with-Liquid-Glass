# Building-an-app-with-Liquid-Glass
Landmarks is a SwifUI app that demonstrates how to use the new dynamic and expressive design feature, Liquid Glass. The Landmarks app lets people explore interesting sites around the world. Whether it’s a national park near their home or a far-flung location on a different continent, the app provides a way for people to organize and mark their adventures and receive custom activity badges along the way. Landmarks runs on iPad, iPhone, and Mac.

Landmarks uses a NavigationSplitView to organize and navigate to content in the app, and demonstrates several key concepts to optimize the use of Liquid Glass:
Stretching content behind the sidebar and inspector with the background extension effect.
Extending horizontal scroll views under a sidebar or inspector.
Leveraging the system-provided glass effect in toolbars.
Applying Liquid Glass effects to custom interface elements and animations.
Building a new app icon with Icon Composer.
The sample also demonstrates several techniques to use when changing window sizes, and for adding global search.
